# Summer-2022-Chosn

Work I did during the summer on a WebApp meant to help user mental health and relationships. 

Texts were sent two times a week automatically through AWS based on user goals.

Worked on adapting Figma Designs into React. Edited files included, along with screenshots of before/after results.

Also created a desktop/mobile version of the website, along with an interactive navigation bar

Navigation bar changes based on if the user is logged in, with a drop down menu.

Not all of the files were edited during the summer, only files I edited are included

Link is included to the unfinished project if you want to run it:
